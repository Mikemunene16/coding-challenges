#### There are programs that takes a user's inputs and calculates various things per coding challenge

#### By **{Mike Munene}**

## Project Description

## Challenge1 : Student Grade Generator

It's program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows:

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

## Challenge 2 : Speed Detector

It's a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

## Challenge 3 : Net Salary Calculator

It's a program that takes the basic salary and benefits of an employee, then calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
